        <h1>Three basic Ice-Cream Flavours</h1>
        <section class="vanilla">
            <div>Vanilla 
            </div>
            <p>Vanilla is a spice derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla, 
               primarily obtained from pods of the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla. 
               Vanilla is the only edible fruit of the orchid family, the largest family of flowering plants in the world. 
               Just like grapes that make wine, no two vanilla beans are the same in flavor, aroma, or color.
               There are over 150 varieties of vanilla plants. Vanilla vines take two to four years to fully mature, 
               and their flowers only bloom for one day of the year. Vanilla is still the most favorite ice cream 
               flavor in the US.

            <div>Chocolate</div>
            <p>Chocolate is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, 
               solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Chocolate is one of the most popular 
               food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts. 
               Chocolate is the only edible substance to melt around 93Â° F, just below the human body temperature. 
               That's why chocolate melts so easily on your tongue.

            <p>The garden strawberry is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries, 
               which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, 
               bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness.Fresh strawberries contain a combination of fruity, 
               caramel, spice and green notes. A green note is a characteristic note used to describe that leafy sometimes 
               woody or smoky sensation you taste with fruits and vegetables.
